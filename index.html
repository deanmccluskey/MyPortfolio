            <h3>"WordSmith, Imagist, CodePro!!!"</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio site! First, a little bit about me...</p>
            <p>I am a Software Developer (in training), who holds a Bachelor's degree in Journalism 
                (Photojournalism) from San Jose State University. Two weeks out of school, I was working 
                as a photographer for the Tahoe Daily Tribune! But I found the salary less than desirable, 
                so I returned to hospitality which had put me through college.</p>
            <p>Later, I returned to school to study Computer Science at Diablo Valley College, where I took 
                courses from basic coding to advanced programming concepts using C/C++, Java, and Assembly. 
                While I worked for a short time as a contractor in the positions of Help Desk, Customer 
                Support and Software Quality Assurance, I never made the transition to Developer. Since then, 
                I have continued work as a Bartender, a Server, and even spent time as a Casino Dealer, 
                where I learned <em>every</em> game in the house!</p>
            <p>Now the time has come for me to return to my passion. While I enjoyed my photography, I love 
                coding more!!! I think the role of software developer, as that of a 21st century scribe, 
                connecting their
                clients to the masses. And the practice of development, especially app functionality, is akin 
                to a mental "Chinese puzzle" (something I loved as a kid)!</p>
            <p>So here I AM, part <em>poet</em>, part <em>artist</em>, and full-on <em><strong>technophile!
                </strong></em> And here is <a href='./portfolio.html'>my work</a>!!!</p>
